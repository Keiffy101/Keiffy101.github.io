# Keiffy101.github.io

Using github as a server for a static website located at amacher.com, Im new to webdevelopment so its a huge learning curver for me at the moment, Im watching alot of tutorials and learning alot then each time I go to write some code on my own I relise how limited my knowledge and practice actually is. I will be patient with myself and continue to learn more, I think the bigest issue im going to have at the moment apart from not knowing all the syntax is the DRY rule, Im sure I can do some parts of my site alot more efficiently. 

If anyone comes across my site and feels like throwing me some suggestions I would reall appriciate it.
