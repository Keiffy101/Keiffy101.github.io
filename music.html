				<p>leavin' on a southern train<br>
				only yesterday you lied,<br>
				promises of what I seemed to be<br>
				only watched the time go by,<br>
				all of these things you said to me.</p>
				
				<p>breathing is the hardest thing<br>
				to do. with all I've said and<br>
				all that's dead for you,<br>
				you lied - good bye</p>

					<p>The words are so familiar<br> 
					All the same greats, the same mistakes<br>  
					It doesn't have to be like this.<br>  
					If you don't make a friend, now<br>  
					One might make you<br>  
					So learn<br>  
					The gentle art of making enemies<br>  
					Don't look so surprised<br>  
					Happy birthday...Fucker<br>  
					Blow that candle out,<br>  
					We're gonnaa kick you<br>  
					[Don't say you're not because you are]<br>  
					[Don't say you're not because you are]<br>

					You put up one hell of a fight<br>  
					I want to hear your very best excuse<br>  
					Never felt this much alive<br>  
					Your day has finally come<br>  
					So wear the hat and do the dance<br>  
					And let the suit keep wearing you.<br>  
					This year you'll sit and take it<br>  
					And you will like it<br>  
					It's the gentle art of making enemies<br>  
					I deserve a reward<br>  
					'cause I'm the best fuck that you ever had<br>  
					And if I tighten up my hole<br>  
					You may never see the light again<br>  
					[There's always an easy way out]<br>  
					[There's always an easy way out]<br>  
					[You need something wet in your mouth]<br>

					<p class="song-title">"Hugh Laurie Sings the Blues - St. James Infirmary" from the NYTimes"</p>
					<p>I went down to St James Infirmary<br>
					Saw my baby there<br>					
					She was stretched out on a long white table<br>
					So cold, so sweet, so sweet, so fair<br>					
					Let her go, let her go, God bless her<br>					
					Wherever she may be<br>					
					She can search this whole wide world over<br>					
					She won't ever find another man like me<br>					
					When I die, bury me in straight laced shoes,<br>					
					A box backed suit and a Stetson hat<br>					
					Put a 20 dollar gold piece on my watch chain;<br>					
					So the boys'll know I died standin' pat</p>

					<p class="song-title">Echos - Pink Floyd</p>
					

						<p>Overhead the albatross<br>
						Hangs motionless upon the air<br> 
						And deep beneath the rolling waves <br>
						In labyrinths of coral caves <br>
						An echo of a distant time <br>
						Comes willowing across the sand <br>
						And everything is green and submarine. <br>

						And no one called us to the land <br>
						And no one knows the where's or why's. <br>
						Something stirs and something tries<br> 
						Starts to climb toward the light.<br> 

						Strangers passing in the street<br> 
						By chance two separate glances meet <br>
						And I am you and what I see is me. <br>
						And do I take you by the hand <br>
						And lead you through the land <br>
						And help me understand <br>
						The best I can. <br>

						And no one called us to the land <br>
						And no one crosses there alive. <br>
						No one speaks and no one tries <br>
						No one flies around the sun.... <br>

						Almost everyday you fall <br>
						Upon my waking eyes, <br>
						Inviting and inciting me <br>
						To rise. 
						And through the window in the wall<br> 
						Come streaming in on sunlight wings <br>
						A million bright ambassadors of morning. <br>

						And no one sings me lullabyes <br>
						And no one makes me close my eyes<br> 
						So I throw the windows wide <br>
						And call to you across the sky....</p>

					<p>Once I had a love and it was a gas<br>

						Seemed like the real thing, only to find<br>
						Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind<br>

						Once I had a love and it was divine<br>
						Soon found out I was losing my mind<br>
						It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind<br>
						Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind<br>

						In between<br>
						What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine<br>
						Love is so confusing there's no peace of mind<br>
						If I fear I'm losing you it's just no good<br>
						You teasing like you do<br>

						Once I had a love and it was a gas<br>
						Soon turned out had a heart of glass<br>
						Seemed like the real thing, only to find<br>
						Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind<br>

						Lost inside<br>
						Adorable illusion and I cannot hide<br>
						I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside<br>
						We could've made it cruising, yeah<br>

						Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light<br>

						Once I had a love and it was a gas<br>
						Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass<br>
						Seemed like the real thing only to find<br>

					<div class="l1">

					<p>She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br>
					I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one<br>
					Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
					She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
					She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene<br>
					Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one<br>
					Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
					People always told me be careful of what you do<br>
					And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
					And mother always told me be careful of who you love<br>
					And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth<br>
					Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
					She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
					But the kid is not my son<br>
					She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
					For forty days and forty nights<br>
					The law was on her side<br>
					But who can stand when she's in demand<br>
					Her schemes and plans<br>
					'cause we danced on the floor in the round<br>
					So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice<br>
					(do think twice.)<br>
					She told my baby we'd danced 'til three<br>
					Then she looked at me<br>
					She showed a photo of a baby crying</p>
					</div>
					<div class="l2">
					<p>His eyes looked like mine<br>
					Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby<br>
					People always told me be careful of what you do<br>
					And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
					She came and stood right by me<br>
					Then the smell of sweet perfume<br>
					This happened much too soon<br>
					She called me to her room<br>
					Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
					She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
					But the kid is not my son<br>
					Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
					She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
					But the kid is not my son<br>

					She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
					But the kid is not my son<br>
					She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
					She says I am the one, she says he is my son<br>
					She says I am the one<br>
					Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
					Billie Jean is not my lover<br>

					<p>Lyrics from original song</p>

					<p>You should begone beast<br>
					Begone from me<br>
					Begone from my mind at least<br>
					Let a little lady be<br>

					I don't want you to want me<br>
					Wouldn't want you to know<br>
					I don't care where you've gone beast<br>
					I care you go<br>

					Take the night off<br>
					And be bad for me<br>
					Take your right off<br>
					And be bad for me<br>

					You're a night bird, early riser<br>
					You have the kind of wing<br>
					To take her and surprise her<br>

					I didn't understand where you had gone<br>
					Didn't know you'd be right back<br>
					I didn't hear the night song<br>
					Calling for you into the black<br>

					Take the night off<br>
					And be bad for me<br>

					Didn't ask you to save me<br>
					Not when you knew me well<br>
					Wouldn't ask you even to behave for me<br>
					I know there's no helping hell<br>

					Take the night off<br>
					And be bad for me<br>

					Take your right off<br>
					And be bad for me</p>

					I dressed it up with love<br>
					I crossed the Seven Seas to you<br>
					Will it be enough?<br>
					And I will be a rainbow<br>
					Oh, while your storm is gone<br>

					And I will bring my song to you<br>
					And I will carry on<br>

					Love is enough<br>
					Though the world be a wind<br>
					And the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining<br>
					My hands shall not tremble, my feet shall not falter<br>
					The voyage shall not weary, the fish shall not alter<br>
					Hmm, It's rainbow, oh it's rainbow<br>
					Oh, can't you see the eyes are the eyes of a lover<br>

					Pocket full of hearts<br>
					A world that's filled with love<br>
					A love that carries all before<br>
					The passion and the flood<br>
					I lie beneath the rainbow<br>

					Now your tears have gone<br>
					And I will sing my song for you<br>
					And I will carry on<br>

					<p class="song-title">Dire Straits - Brothers In Arms</p>

					<p>These mist covered mountains<br>
					Are a home now for me<br>
					But my home is the lowlands<br>
					And always will be<br>
					Someday you'll return to<br>
					Your valleys and your farms<br>
					And you'll no longer burn to be<br>
					Brothers in arms<br>

					Through these fields of destruction<br>
					Baptisms of fire<br>
					I've witnessed your suffering<br>
					As the battle raged higher<br>
					And though they did hurt me so bad<br>
					In the fear and alarm<br>
					You did not desert me<br>
					My brothers in arms<br>

					There's so many different worlds<br>
					So many different suns<br>
					And we have just one world<br>
					But we live in different ones<br>

					Now the sun's gone to hell and<br>
					The moon's riding high<br>
					Let me bid you farewell<br>
					Every man has to die<br>
					But it's written in the starlight<br>
					And every line in your palm<br>
					We are fools to make war<br>
					On our brothers in arms</p>

					Que busca en el monte amparo.<br>

					The words mean "I am a truthful man from the land of the palm trees.<br>
					And before dying, I want to share these poems of my soul.<br>
					My poems are soft green. My poems are also flaming crimson.<br>
					My poems are like a wounded fawn seeking refuge in the forest.<br>

					The last verse says: <br>
					'Con los pobres de la tierra'. <br>
					With the poor people of this earth I want to share my fate. <br>
					The streams of the mountains please me more than the sea. "<br>

					But if you really loved me<br>
					You would've endured my world<br>

					Well if you're just as I presumed<br>
					A whore in sheep's clothing<br>
					Fucking up all I do<br>
					And if so here we stop<br>
					Then never again<br>
					Will you see this in your life<br>

					Hang on to the glory at my right hand<br>
					Here laid to rest is our love ever longed<br>
					With truth on the shores of compassion<br>
					You seem to take premise to all of these songs<br>

					You stormed off to scar the armada<br>
					Like Jesus played martyr,<br>
					I'll drill through your hands<br>
					The stone for the curse you have blamed me<br>
					With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep<br>
					But if you could just write me out<br>
					To neverless wonder... happy will I become<br>
					Be true that this is no option,<br>
					So with sin I condemn you<br>
					Demon play, demon out!<br>

					Hang on to the glory at my right hand<br>
					Here laid to rest is our love ever longed<br>
					With truth on the shores of compassion<br>
					You seem to take premise to all of these songs<br>

					One last kiss for you<br>
					One more wish to you<br>
					Please make up your mind girl...<br>
					I'd do anything for you<br>
					One last kiss for you<br>
					One more wish to you<br>
					Please make up your mind girl...<br>
					Before I hope you die</p>

					<p>Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face<br>
					The kind you'd find on someone I could save<br>
					If they don't put me away<br>
					Well, it'll be a miracle<br>

					Do you believe you're missin' out<br>
					That everything good is happening somewhere else?<br>
					But with nobody in your bed<br>
					The night's hard to get through<br>

					And I will die all alone<br>
					And when I arrive I won't know anyone<br>

					Well, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again<br>
					So what did you do those three days you were dead?<br>
					'cause this problem's gonna last more than the weekend.<br>

					Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die,<br>
					I'm a little bit scared of what comes after<br>
					Do I get the gold chariot?<br>
					Do I float through the ceiling?<br>

					Do I divide and fall apart?<br>
					'cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark<br>
					And the ship went down in sight of land<br>
					And at the gates, does Thomas ask to see my hands?<br>

					I know you're coming in the night like a thief<br>
					But I've had some time alone to hone my lying technique<br>
					I know you think that I'm someone you can trust<br>
					But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail <br>you back up (everyone now)<br>

					So do you think that we could work out a sign<br>
					So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try<br>

					I know you're coming for the people like me<br>
					We all got wood and nails<br>
					And tongue-tied at hate factories<br>
					We all got wood and nails<br>
					And tongue-tied at hate factories<br>
					We all got wood and nails<br>
					And we sleep inside of this machine</p>

				<p class="song-title">Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven</p>

				<p>There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold<br>
				And she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>
				When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed<br>
				With a word she can get what she came for.<br>
				Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.<br>

				There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure<br>
				'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.<br>
				In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,<br>
				Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.<br>

				Ooh, it makes me wonder,<br>
				Ooh, it makes me wonder.<br>

				There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,<br>
				And my spirit is crying for leaving.<br>
				In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,<br>
				And the voices of those who stand looking.<br>

				Ooh, it makes me wonder,<br>
				Ooh, it really makes me wonder.<br>

				And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,<br>
				Then the piper will lead us to reason.<br>
				And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,<br>
				And the forests will echo with laughter.<br>

				If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,<br>
				It's just a spring clean for the May queen.<br>
				Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br>
				There's still time to change the road you're on.<br>
				And it makes me wonder.<br>

				Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,<br>
				The piper's calling you to join him,<br>
				Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know<br>
				Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?<br>

				And as we wind on down the road<br>
				Our shadows taller than our soul.<br>
				There walks a lady we all know<br>
				Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
				How everything still turns to gold.<br>
				And if you listen very hard<br>
				The tune will come to you at last.<br>
				When all are one and one is all<br>
				To be a rock and not to roll.<br>
				And she's buying a stairway to heaven</p>

				Hey you, are you trying to be mean?<br>
				If you live with apes man, it's hard to be clean<br>

				The worms will live in every host<br>
				It's hard to pick which one they eat most<br>

				The horrible people, the horrible people<br>

				<p>I dreamed of my old lover last night<br>

				And if by chance my husband overheard<br>
				He'd put my face back in the crowd<br>

				His eyes were clear and gentle then<br>
				He'd kissed the troubles from my brow<br>
				I long to fall to sleep again<br>
				I wondered how he would look now<br>

				Would our kids grow stubborn or grow strong?<br>
				Would their limbs bronze insult to the sun?<br>
				I wondered how it feels but then<br>
				I rarely dream of anyone<br>

				In the songs of shame and the tales of dread<br>
				Where they seal the lovers' lips with lead<br>
				And all the vines wind through their eyes<br>
				But no one knows this passion now<br>
				But no one knows this passion now<br>

				So I keep this fancy to myself<br>
				I keep my lipstick twisted tight<br>
				I long to fall to sleep again<br>
				'Cause I dreamed of my old lover last night<br>
				I long to fall to sleep again<br>

				<p class="song-title">John Wesley Harding - Jackson Cage</p>

				<p>Driving home she grabs something to eat<br>
				Turns a corner and drives down her street<br>
				Into a row of houses she melts away<br>
				Like the scenery in another man's play<br>
				To a house where the blinds are closed<br>
				To keep from seeing things she don't wanna know<br>
				She pulls the blinds, she looks out on the street<br>
				The cool of the night takes the edge off the heat<br>

				In the Jackson Cage<br>
				Down in the Jackson Cage<br>
				You can try with all your might<br>
				But you're reminded every night<br>
				That you've been judged and handed life<br>
				Down in the Jackson Cage<br>

				Every day ends in wasted motion<br>
				Crossed swords on the killing floor<br>
				To settle back is to settle without knowing<br>
				The hard edge that you're settling for<br>
				'Cause there's always just one more day<br>
				And it always will be that way<br>
				Girl, you've been down here so long<br>
				I could tell by the way that you move you belong<br>

				To the Jackson Cage<br>
				Down in the Jackson Cage<br>
				And it don't matter just what you say<br>
				Are you tough enough to play the game they play?<br>
				Will you just do your time and fade away<br>
				Down in the Jackson Cage?<br>
				Down in the Jackson Cage<br>

				It's nights when I dream of a better world<br>
				But I wake up so downhearted, girl<br>
				I see you feeling so tired and confused<br>
				I wonder what it's worth to me or you<br>
				Just waiting to see some sun<br>
				Never knowing if that day will come<br>
				Left alone standing out on the street<br>
				Till you become the hand that turns the key<br>

				To the Jackson Cage<br>
				Down in the Jackson Cage<br>
				Well, darling, can you understand<br>
				The way that they will turn a man<br>
				Into a stranger to waste away<br>
				Down in the Jackson Cage</p>

				<p class="song-title">Rage Against the Machine - Ghost of Tom Joad</p>

				<p>Man walks along the railroad track<br>
				He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back <br>
				The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge<br>
				Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge<br>
				The shelter line stretchin' around the corner<br>
				Welcome to the New World Order<br>
				Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest<br>
				No job, no home, no peace, no rest, NO REST!<br>

				And The highway is alive tonight<br>
				Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes<br>
				I'm sitting down here in the campfire light<br>
				Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad<br>

				He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag<br>
				The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag<br>
				He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the <br>first shall be last<br>
				In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass<br>
				With a one way ticket to the promised land<br>
				With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand<br>
				Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock<br>
				Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts<br>

				And The highway is alive tonight<br>
				Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes <br>
				I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light<br>
				With the Ghost of old Tom Joad<br>

				Now Tom Said; "Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy<br>
				Wherever a hungry new born baby cries<br>
				Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air<br>
				Look for me ma' <br>
				I'll be there<br>
				Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand<br>
				For a decent job or a helpin' hand<br>
				Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free<br>
				Look in their eyes ma, <br>
				You'll see me! <br>

				And the highway is alive tonight<br>
				nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes<br>
				I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light<br>
				With the Ghost of Tom Joad.</p>

				<p class="song-title">Eagles - Hotel California</p>

				<p>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
				Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air<br>
				Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light<br>
				My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br>
				I had to stop for the night<br>
				There she stood in the doorway;<br>
				I heard the mission bell<br>
				And I was thinking to myself,<br>
				"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"<br>
				Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way<br>
				There were voices down the corridor,<br>
				I thought I heard them say...<br>

				Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
				Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)<br>
				Such a lovely face<br>
				Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>
				Any time of year (Any time of year)<br>
				You can find it here<br>

				Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends<br>
				She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends<br>
				How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.<br>
				Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>

				So I called up the Captain,<br>
				"Please bring me my wine"<br>
				He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty<br> nine"
				And still those voices are calling from far away,<br>
				Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>
				Just to hear them say...<br>

				Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
				Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)<br>
				Such a lovely face<br>
				They livin' it up at the Hotel California<br>
				What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)<br>
				Bring your alibis<br>

				Mirrors on the ceiling,<br>
				The pink champagne on ice<br>
				And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
				And in the master's chambers,<br>
				They gathered for the feast<br>
				They stab it with their steely knives,<br>
				But they just can't kill the beast<br>

				Last thing I remember, I was<br>
				Running for the door<br>
				I had to find the passage back<br>
				To the place I was before<br>
				"Relax, " said the night man,<br>
				"We are programmed to receive.<br>
				You can check-out any time you like,<br>
				But you can never leave! "</p>

				<p class="song-title">Michael Sembello - Flashdance - Maniac</p>

				<p>Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night<br>
				Looking for the fight of her life<br>
				In the real time world, no one sees her at all<br>
				They all say she's crazy<br>

				Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart<br>
				Changing movement into light<br>
				She has danced into the danger zone<br>
				When the dancer becomes the dance<br>

				It can cut you like a knife<br>
				If the gift becomes the fire<br>
				On the wire between will and what will be<br>

				She's a maniac, maniac on the floor<br>
				And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
				She's a maniac, maniac on the floor<br>
				And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>

				On the ice blue line of insanity<br>
				Is a place most never see<br>
				It's a hard won place of mystery<br>
				Touch it but can't hold it<br>

				You work all your life for that moment in time<br>
				It can come or pass you by<br>
				It's push-shove world but there's always a chance<br>
				If the hunger stays the night<br>

				There's a cold kinetic heat<br>
				Struggling, stretching for the peak<br>
				Never stopping with her head against the wind<br>

				She's a maniac, maniac at your love<br>
				And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
				She's a maniac, maniac at your love<br>
				And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>

				It can cut you like a knife<br>
				If the gift becomes the fire<br>
				On the wire between will and what will be<br>

				She's a maniac, maniac at your love<br>
				And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
				She's a maniac, maniac at your love<br>
				And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>

				Maniac, maniac at your love<br>
				And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
				She's a maniac, maniac at your love<br>
				And she's dancing like she's never danced before</p>

				<p class="song-title">Coolio - Gangstas Paradise</p>
				<p>As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death<br>
				I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left<br>
				'Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long,<br>
				That even my mama thinks that my mind is gone<br>
				But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it<br>
				Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of<br>
				You better watch how you're talking and where you're walking<br>
				Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk<br>
				I really hate to trip but I gotta loc<br>
				As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool<br>
				I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like<br>
				On my knees in the night saying prayers in the streetlight<br>

				Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>
				Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>
				Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>
				Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>

				Look at the situation they got me facin'<br>
				I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the streets<br>
				So I gotta be down with the hood team<br>
				Too much television watching got me chasing dreams<br>
				I'm an educated fool with money on my mind<br>
				Got my 10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye<br>
				I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger<br>
				And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool<br>
				Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away,<br>
				I'm living life, do or die, what can I say<br>
				I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24<br>
				The way things are going I don't know<br>

				Tell me why are we so blind to see<br>
				That the ones we hurt are you and me<br>

				Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>
				Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>
				Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>
				Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>

				Power and the money, money and the power<br>
				Minute after minute, hour after hour<br>
				Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking<br>
				What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'<br>
				They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me<br>
				If they can't understand it, how can they reach me<br>
				I guess they can't, I guess they won't<br>
				I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool<br>

				Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>
				Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>
				Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>
				Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise<br>

				Tell me why are we so blind to see<br>
				That the ones we hurt are you and me<br>

				<p class="song-title">Would You Be Impressed? - Streetlight Manifesto</p>
				<p>Would you be upset if I told you we were dying?<br>
				And every cure they gave us was a lie?<br>
				Oh! They mean it when they say we're dead and doomed <br>
				And every single symptom brings us closer to the tomb <br>
				And who will take the credit for our swift impending fall <br>
				Because it's not my fault <br>

				Would you be impressed if I said that the dead would help us <br>counting <br>
				Every single moment that we waste our time? <br>
				All the time we're spending vaccinating this disease <br>
				I just get dizzy when I think of all the ways we try to hide our maladies <br>
				We wine (we wine), we dine (we dine), and everything is fine <br>
				Because it's not my fault <br>

				Now you're upset because you finally got the notion <br>
				That everything you had is spinning down the drain <br>
				Oh! Do you mean it when you beg and pray and plead? <br>
				Your "Giveittomegiveittomegiveittomegiveittome all those things we need" <br>
				And what, pray tell, will you whimper when your number will be called <br>
				You'll say "It's not my fault" <br>

				Go! Now! The others they'll await you <br>
				And every single one among the lot of you will have your turn <br>
				Ai Ai Ai Oh Oh OH <br>
				Like moths that fly into the flame it always ends up so <br>
				You scream: "Not me! Take anybody else! <br>
				Because it's not my fault!" <br>

				I had a dream last night where everyone was trying <br>
				Subconsciously I knew it was a lie <br>
				And when I woke I knew it was time to pray <br>
				To make amends before the end, before my judgment day <br>
				I looked around, I stood alone, I knew what I had to say <br>
				I said "It's all my fault"</p>

				<p class="song-title">Johnny Cash & Kristoffersen -- Sunday Morning Coming Down</p>
				<p>Well, I woke up Sunday morning<br>
				With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt.<br>
				And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,<br>
				So I had one more for dessert.<br>
				Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes<br>
				And found my cleanest dirty shirt.<br>
				Then I washed my face and combed my hair<br>
				And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.<br>

				I'd smoked my mind the night before<br>
				With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking.<br>
				But I lit my first and watched a small kid<br>
				Playing with a can that he was kicking.<br>
				Then I walked across the street<br>
				And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken.<br>
				And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost<br>
				Somewhere, somehow along the way.<br>

				On a Sunday morning sidewalk,<br>
				I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.<br>
				'Cause there's something in a Sunday<br>
				That makes a body feel alone.<br>
				And there's nothing short a' dying<br>
				That's half as lonesome as the sound<br>
				Of the sleeping city sidewalk<br>
				And Sunday morning coming down.<br>

				In the park I saw a daddy<br>
				With a laughing little girl that he was swinging.<br>
				And I stopped beside a Sunday school<br>
				And listened to the songs they were singing.<br>
				Then I headed down the street,<br>
				And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing,<br>
				And it echoed through the canyon<br>
				Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.<br>

				On a Sunday morning sidewalk,<br>
				I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.<br>
				'Cause there's something in a Sunday<br>
				That makes a body feel alone.<br>
				And there's nothing short a' dying<br>
				That's half as lonesome as the sound<br>
				Of the sleeping city sidewalk<br>7
				And Sunday morning coming down.</p>

				<p class="song-title">Me First And The Gimme Gimmes - I Believe I Can Fly</p>
				<p>I used to think<br>
				that I could not go on<br>
				And life was nothing but an awful song<br>
				But now I know the meaning of true love<br>
				I'm leaning on the everlasting arms<br>

				If I can see it, then I can do it<br>
				If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
				I believe I can fly<br>
				I believe I can touch the sky<br>
				I think about it every night and day<br>
				Spread my wings and fly away<br>
				I believe I can soar<br>
				I see me running through that open door<br>
				I believe I can fly<br>
				I believe I can fly<br>
				I believe I can fly<br>

				See I was on the verge of breaking down<br>
				Sometimes the silence can seem so loud<br>
				There are miracles in life I must achieve<br>
				But first I know it starts inside of me<br>

				If I can see it, then I can be it<br>
				If I can believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
				I believe I can fly<br>
				I believe I can touch the sky<br>

				I believe I can soar<br>
				I see me running through that open door<br>
				I believe I can fly<br>
				I believe I can fly<br>
				I believe I can fly<br>

				Cause I believe in you<br>

				If I can see it, then I can do it<br>
				If I can believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
				I believe I can fly<br>
				I believe I can touch the sky<br>

				<p class="song-title">Me first and the gimme gimmes - Riders in the sky</p>
				<p>Two young cowboys went riding out one dark and windy day<br>
				Upon a ridge they rested as they went up on their way<br>
				When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed sheep they saw<br>
				A plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw<br>

				Yippie yi yay, yippie yi ooh<br>
				Ghost Riders in the sky<br>
				Yippie yi yay, yippie yi ooh<br>
				Ghost Riders in the sky<br>

				Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel<br>
				His heart was black and shiny and his hot breath he could feel<br>
				A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky<br>
				For he saw his Rider coming hard and he heard his joyful cry<br>

				Yippie yi yay, yippie yi ooh<br>
				Ghost Riders in the sky<br>
				Yippie yi yay, yippie yi ooh<br>

				<p class="song-title">David Bowie - Changes</p>
				<p>I still don't know what I was waiting for<br>
				And my time was running wild<br>
				A million dead-end streets<br>
				and every time I thought I'd got it made<br>
				It seemed the taste was not so sweet<br>
				So I turned myself to face me<br>
				But I've never caught a glimpse<br>
				Of how the others must see the faker<br>
				I'm much too fast to take that test<br>

				Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes<br>
				(Turn and face the strain)<br>
				Ch-ch-Changes<br>
				Don't want to be a richer man<br>
				Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes<br>
				(Turn and face the strain)<br>
				Ch-ch-Changes<br>
				Just gonna have to be a different man<br>
				Time may change me<br>
				But I can't trace time<br>

				I watch the ripples change their size<br>
				But never leave the stream<br>
				Of warm impermanence and<br>
				So the days float through my eyes<br>
				But still the days seem the same<br>
				And these children that you spit on<br>
				As they try to change their worlds<br>
				Are immune to your consultations<br>
				They're quite aware of what they're going through<br>

				Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes<br>
				(Turn and face the strain)<br>
				Ch-ch-Changes<br>
				Don't tell them to grow up and out of it<br>
				Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes<br>
				(Turn and face the strain)<br>
				Ch-ch-Changes<br>
				Where's your shame<br>
				You've left us up to our necks in it<br>
				Time may change me<br>
				But you can't trace time<br>

				Strange fascination, fascinating me<br>
				Changes are taking the pace<br>
				I'm going through<br>

				Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes<br>
				(Turn and face the strain)<br>
				Ch-ch-Changes<br>
				Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers<br>
				Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes<br>
				(Turn and face the strain)<br>
				Ch-ch-Changes<br>
				Pretty soon now you're gonna get older<br>
				Time may change me<br>
				But I can't trace time<br>
				I said that time may change me<br>
				But I can't trace time</p>

				<p>I feel unhappy<br>
				I feel so sad<br>
				I lost the best friend<br>
				That I ever had<br>

				She was my woman<br>
				I loved her so<br>
				But it's too late now<br>
				I've let her go<br>

				I'm going through changes<br>
				I'm going through changes<br>

				We shared the eve's<br>
				We shared each day<br>
				In love together<br>
				We found a way<br>

				But soon the world<br>
				Had its evil way<br>
				My heart was blinded<br>
				Love went astray<br>

				I'm going through changes<br>
				I'm going through changes<br>

				It took so long<br>
				To realize<br>
				That I can still hear<br>
				Her last goodbyes<br>

				Now all my days<br>

				Wish I could go back<br>
				And change these years<br>

				<p>Whiskey woman don't you know that you are drivin' me insane<br>
				The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain<br>
				Don't you know you're driving me insane<br>
				You're tryin' to find your way through life<br>
				You're tryin' to get some new direction<br>
				Another woman got her man<br>
				She won't find no new connection<br>

				Takes another drink or two, things look better when she's through<br>

				Takes another look around, you're not goin' anywhere<br>
				You've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care<br>
				You're tryin' to find your way again<br>
				You're tryin' to find some new...<br>
				Another woman's got her man<br>
				But she won't find a new...<br>

				Takes another drink or two, things look better when she's through<br>

				You 'bin foolin' with some hot guy<br>
				I want to know why is it why<br>
				Get up get out you know you really blew it<br>
				I've had enough, I've had enough, good God pluck me<br>
				Once she was wonderful<br>
				Once she was fine<br>
				Once she was beautiful<br>
				Once she was mine...she was mine<br>

				Now change has come over her body, she doesn't see me anymore<br>
				Now change has come over her body, she doesn't see me anymore<br>

				Changes, changes, changes, changes<br>

				<p class="song-title">2pac - changes</p>
				<p>Come on come on<br>
				I see no changes. Wake up in the morning and I ask myself,<br>
				"Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?"<br>
				I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black.<br>
				My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.<br>
				Cops give a damn about a negro? Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero.<br>
				Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare.<br>
				First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers.<br>
				Give 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other.<br>
				"It's time to fight back", that's what Huey said.<br>
				2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead.<br>
				I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere<br>
				unless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes.<br>
				Learn to see me as a brother 'stead of 2 distant strangers.<br>
				And that's how it's supposed to be.<br>
				How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?<br>
				I'd love to go back to when we played as kids<br>
				but things changed, and that's the way it is<br>
				Come on come on<br>
				That's just the way it is<br>
				Things'll never be the same<br>
				That's just the way it is<br>
				aww yeah<br>

				I see no changes. All I see is racist faces.<br>
				Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races we under.<br>
				I wonder what it takes to make this one better place...<br>
				let's erase the wasted.<br>
				Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right.<br>
				'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight.<br>
				And only time we chill is when we kill each other.<br>
				It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other.<br>
				And although it seems heaven sent,<br>
				we ain't ready to see a black President, uhh.<br>
				It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact...<br>
				the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks.<br>
				But some things will never change.<br>
				Try to show another way, but they stayin' in the dope game.<br>
				Now tell me what's a mother to do?<br>
				Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you.<br>
				You gotta operate the easy way.<br>
				"I made a G today" But you made it in a sleazy way.<br>
				Sellin' crack to the kids. "I gotta get paid,"<br>
				Well hey, well that's the way it is.<br>
				We gotta make a change...<br>
				It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.<br>
				Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live<br>
				and let's change the way we treat each other.<br>
				You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do<br>
				what we gotta do, to survive.<br>

				And still I see no changes. Can't a brother get a little peace?<br>
				There's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East.<br>
				Instead of war on poverty,<br>
				they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me.<br>
				And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do.<br>
				But now I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you.<br>
				Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up, crack you up and pimp smack you up.<br>
				You gotta learn to hold ya own.<br>
				They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone.<br>
				But tell the cops they can't touch this.<br>
				I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this.<br>
				That's the sound of my tool. You say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no fool.<br>
				And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped and I never get to lay back.<br>
				'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback.<br>
				Some buck that I roughed up way back... comin' back after all these years.<br>
				Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. That's the way it is. uhh<br>
				Some things will never change</p>

				<p>Watching every motion<br>
				In my foolish lover's game<br>
				On this endless ocean<br>
				Finally lovers know no shame<br>

				Turning and returning<br>
				To some secret place inside<br>
				Watching in slow motion<br>
				As you turn around and say<br>

				Take my breath away<br>
				Take my breath away<br>

				Watching I keep waiting<br>
				Still anticipating love<br>
				Never hesitating<br>
				To become the fated ones<br>

				Turning and returning<br>
				To some secret place to find<br>
				Watching in slow motion<br>
				As you turn to me and say, "My Love"<br>

				Take my breath away<br>

				Through the hourglass I saw you<br>
				In time you slipped away<br>
				When the mirror crashed I called you<br>
				And turned to hear you say, "If only for today, I am unafraid"<br>

				Take my breath away<br>
				Take my breath away<br>

				Watching every motion<br>
				In this foolish lover's game<br>
				Haunted by the notion<br>
				Somewhere there's a love in flames<br>

				Turning and returning
				To some secret place inside<br>
				Watching in slow motion<br>
				As you turn my way, and say<br>

				Take my breath away<br>
				My Love, take my breath away<br>
				My Love, take my breath away, Oh-Oh<br>
				My Love, take my breath away</p>

				<p class="song-title">Rodriguez - Establishment Blues</p>
				<p>The mayor hides the crime rate
				council woman hesitates<br>
				Public gets irate but forget the vote date<br>
				Weatherman complaining, predicted sun, it's raining<br>
				Everyone's protesting, boyfriend keeps suggesting<br>
				you're not like all of the rest.<br>

				Garbage ain't collected, women ain't protected<br>
				Politicians using people they're abusing<br>
				The mafia's getting bigger, like pollution in the river<br>
				And you tell me that this is where it's at.<br>

				Woke up this moming with an ache in my head<br>
				Splashed on my clothes as I spilled out of bed<br>
				Opened the window to listen to the news<br>
				But all I heard was the Establishment's Blues.<br>

				Gun sales are soaring, housewives find life boring<br>
				Divorce the only answer smoking causes cancer<br>
				This system's gonna fall soon, to an angry young tune<br>
				And that's a concrete cold fact.<br>

				The pope digs population, freedom from taxation<br>
				Teeny Bops are up tight, drinking at a stoplight<br>
				Miniskirt is flirting I can't stop so I'm hurting<br>
				Spinster sells her hopeless chest.<br>

				Adultery plays the kitchen, bigot cops non-fiction<br>
				The little man gets shafted, sons and monies drafted<br>
				Living by a time piece, new war in the far east.<br>
				Can you pass the Rorschach test?<br>

				It's a hassle is an educated guess.<br>
				Well, frankly I couldn't care less.</p>
